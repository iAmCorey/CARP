# CARP
# The definition of CARP
CARP - Capacitated Arc Routing Problem

Consider an undirected connected graph ùê∫ = (ùëâ, ùê∏), with a vertex set ùëâ and an edge set ùê∏ and a set of required edges (tasks) ùëá ‚äÜ ùê∏. 
A fleet of identical vehicles, each of capacity ùëÑ, is based at a designated depot vertex ùë£0 ‚ààùëâ. Each edge ùëí‚ààùê∏ incurs a cost ùëê(ùëí)whenever a vehicle travels over it or serves it (if it is a task). Each required edge (task) ùúè ‚àà ùëá has a demand ùëë(ùúè) > 0 associated with it.
The objective of CARP is to determine a set of routes for the vehicle to serve all tasks with minimal costs while satisfying:
    a) Each route must start and end at ùë£0; 
    b) The total demand serviced on each route must not exceed ùëÑ;
    c) Each task must be served exactly once (but the corresponding edge can be traversed more than once)

# Common heuristic method to solve CARP

- Á¶ÅÂøåÊêúÁ¥¢ÁÆóÊ≥ï
- ÊîπËøõÁöÑÈÅó‰º†ÁÆóÊ≥ï
- tabu-scatterÁÆóÊ≥ï

# Input
- the graph G(V,E)
- the cost c(e), and the demand d(e) for each e
- the tasks set T
- v0
- capacity Q


# Steps
Step1: calculate the shortest distance between the depot to every other node. -> 2D-matrix `distances`
Step2: use Path-Scanning method to get a feasible solution
Step3(if have enough time): use the feasible solution as the initial population and use the genetic algorithm to iteration to get a better solution

# Usage
Use the command `python CARP_solver.py < CARP instance file > -t <termination> -s <random seed>` in terminal. 
output: 
Print two lines. Each of them, according to its first char, must belong to one of the categories described below. Lines that do not start with one of the patterns below will be considered a comment and hence ignored.
Solution line begins with a lower case ‚Äús‚Äù followed by a space (ASCII code 32). Only one such line is allowed and it is mandatory.
Quality line begins with a lower case ‚Äúq‚Äù followed by a space (ASCII code 32). Only one such line is allowed and it is mandatory.

e.g.
```
s 0,(1,2),(2,4),(4,1),0,0,(4,3),(3,1),0
q 40
```
